**Unlocking Business Insights: Web Scraping for E-commerce
Health Products (HealthWarehouse.com)**

The project aims to delve into 'How price information of medicines varies across OTC categories and
impacts individuals with no insurance coverage'. The growing market of e-commerce companies in the
health sector has helped change the way of purchasing medicines and its availability. The study utilizes
Selenium to extract product information from healthwarehouse.com, revealing potential disparities that
impact affordability. Additionally, to ensure minimal data loss and maintain data consistency, the
extracted result was stored in a MongoDB database.
Important insights into the dataset were offered by the extracted characteristics, which included title,
price, description, variations, availability, and category in a products table. The analysis yielded
information for over the counter medicines such as ibuprofen being a cheap non prescription medicine,
which is also considered as the most commonly bought drug in the market. The ‘availability’ data for
products showed a notable out-of-stock ratio for popular over-the-counter medications such as in category
Cold. It also demonstrated the wide range of average prices for drugs across different categories, spanning
from$4 to $250. This variation could pose a challenge for individuals facing financial constraints.
